1. Linux is the kernel of the system on which it runs.
2. The kernel acts as a brain that facilitates all the program running on the system.
3. The kernel :-
    a) interfaces with hardware device,adapters,hard-drives etc.
    b) Allocates memory to each individual programs.
    c) Allocates cpu times to each individual programs.
    d) Enables program to interact with each other.

    Note :- when the kernel is combined with all the tools programs and apps then we have os.
4. Linux is open source.
5. The kernel of the os manages all the apps processes on a system.
6. The kernel handles memory allocation of the programs, programs life-cycles(start and termination) and text displays.
7. If two apps needs to use the same resource the kernel decides who will get what and in what order.
8. Kernel implements multi-tasking.
9. Boot Loader :- A small piece of code that loads when a system starts, it loads the linux kernel so that system can run 
                  other programs.
