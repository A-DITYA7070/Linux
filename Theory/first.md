1. Linux is the kernel of the system on which it runs.
2. The kernel acts as a brain that facilitates all the program running on the system.
3. The kernel :-
    a) interfaces with hardware device,adapters,hard-drives etc.
    b) Allocates memory to each individual programs.
    c) Allocates cpu times to each individual programs.
    d) Enables program to interact with each other.

    Note :- when the kernel is combined with all the tools programs and apps then we have os.
4. Linux is open source.
5. The kernel of the os manages all the apps processes on a system.
6. The kernel handles memory allocation of the programs, programs life-cycles(start and termination) and text displays.
7. If two apps needs to use the same resource the kernel decides who will get what and in what order.
8. Kernel implements multi-tasking.
9. Boot Loader :- A small piece of code that loads when a system starts, it loads the linux kernel so that system can run 
                  other programs.
10. The Linux kernel combined with Systems components such as software,programs,apps and packages forms the Linux distribution.
11. The three major linux distributions are.
    a) Red Hat(e.g Fedora,CentOS,Scientific Linux)
       Uses the Red Hat Package Manager (RPM) yum package manager for package management in a system.
       RHEL is commercial and widely used by organisations that host or custom-build their own systems.
       Fedora is a free version (community edition).
    b) Debian (e.g Ubuntu,Linux Mint)
       Fully open-source.
       Ubuntu is most popular derived distribution.
       It uses the dpkg-based apt (Advanced Package Tool) for package management.
       It is widely used in either desktop or server.
    c) SUSE (e.g openSUSE)
       Contains proprietary code and is sold as a server product.
       Community version is OpenSUSE
       Incorporates many features of RHEL.
       Uses the RPM-based zypper package manager for package management.
       Uses the YaST (yet another system tool) for additional system administration.
       OpenSUSE is desktop based and available for general public.
